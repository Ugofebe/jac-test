In ecology, an ecosystem is a naturally occurring assemblage of organisms such \\nas plant, animal and other organisms also referred to as a biotic community, living together in \\ntheir physical environment (or biotope), functioning as a loose interacting unit.  \\n Ecosystems create a biophysical feedback between living (biotic) and nonliving (abiotic) \\ncomponents of an environment that generates and regulates the biogeochemical cycles of the \\nplanet. Ecosystems provide goods and services that sustain human societies and general well-\\nbeing. Ecosystems are sustained by biodiversity within them. Biodiversity refers to the variety of \\nliving species living in a particular ecosystem, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. Ecosystems \\nsustain every life supporting function on the planet, including climate regulation, water filtration, \\nand soil formation (pedogenesis), food, fibers, medicines, erosion control, and many other \\nnatural features of historical, spiritual or scientific value. Ecologists seek to explain: \\n\\uf0b7 life processes and adaptations \\n\\uf0b7 distribution and abundance of organisms \\n\\uf0b7 the movement of materials and energy through living communities \\n\\uf0b7 The succession development of ecosystems. And \\n\\uf0b7 The abundance and distribution of biodiversity in context of the environment. \\n \\nEcosystem Structure \\nThe term ecosystem first appeared in publication by the British ecologist Arthur Tansley in 1935.  \\nAn ecosystem consists of the community of organisms plus the associated physical environment. \\nFor instance in a rangeland ecosystem it is the combination of domestic and wild animal, \\ndifferent species of plants and some nonliving things in an area. The prefix ‘eco’ indicates \\nenvironment and ‘system’ refers to a complex of coordinated units. An ecosystem is a dynamic \\nand complex whole, interacting as an ecological unit. Some consider this the basic unit in \\necology. It is a structured functional unit in equilibrium characterized by energy and material \\nflows between its constituent elements. The size of an ecosystem can vary widely. It may be as \\nbig as a whole forest, or as small as a little pond. Different ecosystems are often separated by\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n2 \\n \\ngeographical barriers, like deserts, mountains or oceans, or are isolated otherwise, like lakes or \\nrivers. As these borders are never rigid, ecosystems tend to blend into each other. As a result, the \\nwhole earth can be seen as a single ecosystem, or a lake can be divided into several ecosystems \\ndepending on the scale used. \\n \\nFigure 1. Interaction of ecosystem \\n \\nEcosystem ecology is the study of the movement of energy and matter through ecosystems. It is \\none of the fundamental disciplines of ecology. The ecosystem is an energy processing system \\nwhose components have evolved together over long period of time. The structure of an \\necosystem is related to energy flow and material cycling through and within the system. The \\norganisms in an ecosystem are usually well balanced with each other and their environment. This \\nbalance is achieved through various types of symbiosis, such as  \\nPredation: feeding relationship in which one organism a predator kills and eats on another \\norganism a prey. \\nParasitism: a feeding relationship in which organism gain from its host. \\nMutualism: in which both organism benefit from each other.  \\nCommensalism: an association between two organisms in which one benefits and the other derives neither \\nbenefit nor harm.\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n3 \\n \\nAmensalism: association between organisms of two different species in which one is inhibited or destroyed \\nand the other is unaffected. \\nHolozoic Nutrition: This is a kind of nutrition upon which the organisms feeds relatively larger \\npiece of organic matter (plant or animal) by killing. \\n \\na) Biotic Components of an Ecosystem \\nThere are various ways of interactions between organisms in an ecosystem. The clearly observed \\nform of interaction is revealed in their energy and food source in the ecosystem. Organisms in \\nany kind of ecosystem could be generally classified or structured into two broad categories based \\non their ability to synthesize their organic molecules: autotrophy and heterotrophy.  \\n \\nFigure 1 A diagrams showing the tropic structuring of in an ecosystem \\n \\n \\nAutotrophs - Organisms with an ecosystem that produce their own food \\n\\uf0b7 Primary producers within an ecosystem \\n\\uf0b7 Make the energy available for ALL organisms \\n\\uf0b7 Photoautotrophs - Absorb light energy to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n4 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Chemoautotrophs - Break down inorganic chemicals for energy to convert \\n \\nHeterotrophs - Organisms that get energy requirements by consuming other organisms \\nCalled Consumers \\n\\uf0b7 Herbivore - Consumer that eats only other autotrophs \\nCow, Rabbit, Grasshopper \\n\\uf0b7 Carnivore - Consumer that preys on other heterotrophs \\nWolves, Lions, hyena leopard. \\n\\uf0b7 Omnivore - Consumer that feeds on both Producers and other consumers \\nHumans, bear, mocking birds \\n\\uf0b7 Detritivores - Consumers that feed on pieces of dead organic matter \\nEarthworm, insects at the bottom of ponds \\n\\uf0b7 Decomposers - Breakdown dead organic material to make nutrients available for \\nproducers to reuse \\nBacteria, fungi \\n \\nb) Abiotic Components of an ecosystem \\nThe abiotic component of an ecosystem is made up of all the substances, factors and forces in the \\nhabitat that affect the organism. The abiotic environment is the result of the interactions among \\nthe energy, inorganic minerals, gases, dead organic matter and a number of other factors and \\nforces. As the result of this interaction, the environment is always in the state of continuous \\nchange or flux. \\n The abiotic component of an ecosystem, hence, could be generally categorized in to the \\nfollowing components: \\n\\uf0b7 Lithosphere: all the solid mineral matter including the soil and rocks; \\n\\uf0b7 Hydrosphere: all the water bodies (in the ocean, lakes, rivers) and its physico-chemical \\ncharacteristics; \\n\\uf0b7 Atmosphere: all the gaseous mixture in the air;\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n5 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Radiant solar energy: the electromagnetic radiation (including visible light) coming from \\nthe sun and stars; and \\n\\uf0b7 Position and movement of the earth, the moon and other extraterrestrial bodies, and their \\ngravitational force. \\n \\nFood chain and Food Web \\nA food chain is a simple food relationship between organisms. It is a link (chain) of organisms, \\none supplying food for the next. Like many simple models, the idea of a food chain only \\nprovides an abstract idea of the way energy flows through an ecological community. A food \\nchain cannot really exist as a single series of connections, isolated from any others. A model \\ndescribing the relationship between organisms in many different food chains is called a food \\nweb. The food web demonstrates the complex patterns of energy flow in an ecosystem. It is \\nbelieved that the more complex a food web is, the more resistant it is to outside interference. \\nThere are two kinds of food chain: \\n \\n \\nFig a. A food chain\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\nFig b. A food web \\n \\nTropic level \\nThe trophic level of an organism is the number of steps it is from the start of the chain. A food web starts \\nat trophic level 1 with primary producers such as plants, can move to herbivores at level 2, carnivores at \\nlevel 3 or higher, and typically finish with apex predators at level 4 or 5.  \\n \\nEcological Pyramids \\nFood chains are morphological systems of energy flow in an ecosystem. However, the energy \\nflow within a system may be described in more quantitative terms using ecological pyramid.\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n7 \\n \\n.  \\nFig c. Ecological pyramids \\nPopulation and population density \\nPopulation is a group of organisms belonging to the same species occupying a particular space at \\na particular time. Individual members of a population are interbreeding and live in a particular \\nplace, in the same time and interact to one another as a society. A particular group of organisms, \\naccording to this definition, should fulfill the following points if it needs to be considered a \\npopulation:  \\n\\uf0b7 Members must belong to the same kind of species  \\n\\uf0b7 All the members must occupy the same place,  \\n\\uf0b7 Members must live in the same time and  \\n\\uf0b7  Members must interact to one another.  \\n \\nPopulation Density \\nIt is defined as the number of individuals of a population per a given unit area. For example, \\n5,000 individual of cattle per a square kilo meter of range land; 300 lions per square kilometer of \\nrangeland; or 500 browse plants per hectare of forestland. It could be also expressed in terms of a \\nunit volume (e.g., 10 million bacteria per a cubic centimeter of water).\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\na. Exponential population growth model \\nThis model assumes that if there is no environmental constraint that hiders a population growth, \\nas a result of which the population shows geometric or exponential increase until it overshoots \\nthe ability of the environment to support it. The growth curve is J-shaped. This kind of \\npopulation growth is common in new habitats where here is no shortage of resources. In this kind \\nof growth, there is exponential relationship between time “t” and the population number at time \\n“t” \\n \\nFig d.  Pattern of exponential growth model \\n \\nb. Logistic growth Model \\nThis growth model assumes that most populations cannot continue to grow exponentially \\nbecause of the resistance coming from their environment that prevents from further growth. As \\nthe result, the population grows exponentially until it reaches the carrying capacity (K). \\nHowever, as the population approaches to the carrying capacity, the growth is limited by the \\nresistant factor hence the population increases arithmetically. Carrying capacity is the maximum \\nnumber of individuals that a habitat could support.\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n9 \\n \\n \\nFig e. Pattern of logistic growth model \\n \\nFactors affecting population density of an Organism \\n\\uf0b7 birth rate (natality),  \\n\\uf0b7 death rates (mortality),  \\n\\uf0b7 immigration and  \\n\\uf0b7 Emigration.  \\n \\nBirth Rate (NATALITY) \\nThis is the number of new individuals added to the population by birth per a given number of \\npopulations (usually 1,000 or 10,000) per year. New individuals could be added through  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 birth\\n\\nBIO 101 (ECOLOGY)  \\n͟͠͞͠\\n \\n10 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 hatching,  \\n\\uf0b7 germination or  \\n\\uf0b7 Fission.  \\nDeath Rate (Mortality) \\nIt refers to the number of individuals removed out of a population through death. It decreases the \\ndensity of a population. It is affected by a number of environmental factors such as,  \\n\\uf0b7 Competition,  \\n\\uf0b7 predation,  \\n\\uf0b7 disease,  \\nEmigration: it is dispersal or migration of individuals away from the population. Individuals \\nleaving a population are called emigrants. \\nImmigration: it is dispersal or migration of individuals into a population. Individuals joining a \\npopulation coming from another group are called immigrants. It increases the population size.'}}},\n",

      "AI Answer: According to the research findings, the early scientists of the Classical era made significant contributions to genetic theories. Specifically, the following scientists are mentioned:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pythagoras**: Although not much information is provided about his contributions to genetics, it's worth noting that Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 6th century BCE. His work on the concept of \"likes attract likes\" might have laid some groundwork for understanding the idea of genetic similarity or heredity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Hippocrates**: As the founder of Western medicine, Hippocrates (460-370 BCE) is credited with making significant contributions to the field of genetics. His work on the concept of \"like begets like\" and the idea that diseases can be inherited through the mother's side suggest that he had an early understanding of heredity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Aristotle** (384-322 BCE): Aristotle's work on biology, particularly his treatise \"Generation of Animals,\" discusses the concept of heredity and the idea that living organisms pass on characteristics to their offspring.
